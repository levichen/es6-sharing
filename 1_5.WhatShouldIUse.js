// I work on the V8 JavaScript engine at Google.

// The only difference between const and let is that const makes the contract that no rebinding will happen.

// Everything I wrote here so far are facts. What follows is entirely subjective, but bear with me.

// Given the above, const makes code easier to read: within its scope, a const variable always refers to the same object. With let there is no such guarantee. As a result, it makes sense to use let and const as follows in your ES6 code:

// * use const by default
// * only use let if rebinding is needed
// * (var shouldnâ€™t be used in ES6)
